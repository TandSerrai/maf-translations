  intro: [[missing - original: Knights are lower nobles who fight in your name, using your soldiers. To attract new knights to your banner, you can set aside soldiers on your estate(s) that are available immediately to any knight on the condition of his loyalty.<br /> Be aware of robber-knights, though. You should not make the majority of your troops available this way, or your new knights just might decide that looting or taking your estate is more rewarding.
