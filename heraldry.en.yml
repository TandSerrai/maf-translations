title:		Heraldry
intro: >
  For a few credits, you can design a unique heraldic crest that you can assign to any of your characters. Once created, the crest is
  yours forever, and you can assign it to as many characters of yours as you want.<br />
  Once created, a crest is locked and cannot be created by someone else again, so the crest is always unique to you. Like actual crests,
  it can be used to uniquely identify a family or dynasty.
