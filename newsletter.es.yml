# 0: ((missing translation - original: <p>Welcome to the Might & Fealty New Player Guide. As the game is a fair bit deep, you as a new player will get exclusive, daily hints and tricks to get into the game in what I hope to be the best way. Of course, as always in this game, you are very welcome to experiment on your own as well.</p> <p>Today, in case you have missed it, allow me to remind you that the game has a nice <a href="http://mightandfealty.com/manual">manual, which includes a tutorial video</a>. This will help you to get started after creating your first character.</p> <p>But you should not stop there. Being a sandbox, the different areas and realms in the game world are at different levels of activity and interest at any given time. You really should create several characters and put them into different places around the map, so you can experience various environments and figure out quickly which you like best.</p>))
# 1: ((missing translation - original: <p>Welcome to the second part of the Might & Fealty New Player Guide. Remember, these are exclusive hints for new players, to help you get into the game in the best possible way.</p> <p>By now, you have certainly started a few characters and jumped into the game world. It may appear very calm and quiet at first, but looks can be deceiving.<br /> In addition to communicating with your liege (if you accepted a knight offer), there are also <i>Realm Conversations</i> going on that let you talk to everyone within your realm - or realms if you joined a sub-realm that is part of a larger one.<br /> In addition to letting you know what is going on around the realm, these conversations are also your best and most direct route to other players who are, by shared bonds, your allies more often than not. In addition to talking to your liege, this is where you can ask questions or get some help from fellow players. Do not hesitate to ask, or simply to introduce your characters with a short roleplay.</p>))
# 2: ((missing translation - original: <p>More exclusive hints and tricks for you and your Might & Fealty gameplay experience. Today, we will focus on unit management.</p> <p>Either through a knight offer, or due to some lord generously (read: expecting your service in return) granting you some troops, at least one of your characters should have some soldiers by now. Check them out - in the menu bar, find "Status" and in the pop-up menu you can see "Your Soldiers". When you click on it, a list of all your soldiers shows up, with detailed information about every single one of them. Take some time to explore this page, as it tells you everything you could ever want to know about your soldiers.</p> <p>You will see an empty select box next to each one. This is where you can issue orders to your soldiers. Which orders are available depends on your location and other factors. For example, the option to resupply will only appear if you are in a settlement that allows you to use its facilities and your soldier is in need of resupply.</p> <p>There is also a similar screen for your entourage, also available through the menu. Check it out as well!</p>))
# 3: ((missing translation - original: <p>Today, our exclusive Might & Fealty hint will tell you how to go deeper, much deeper, into the gameplay.</p> <p>As a new knight, so far you have managed a small unit of soldiers and maybe walked around and discovered the game world a little. But that is only the surface.</p> <p>The core of Might & Fealty is that you can reach your goals in many different ways. There are three main channels for your power: Military, Political and Economical. To have the deepest and most satisfying gameplay, you should explore all of them, possibly with different characters.</p> <p><b>Military</b> power is soldiers under your command. Train them, maintain them well and always strive to get more and better equipped ones. 10 heavily armoured knights will wipe the floor with 10 light infantry. If you command a powerful army, you can go anywhere and simply take what you desire.</p> <p>That is, until you meet someone with <b>Political</b> power. As a politician, you may not command a strong army yourself, but you can call upon vassals, allies and others to do your fighting for you. By making alliances, brokering deals and managing fealty properly, you are never alone and your power can far exceed that which you could hold on your own.</p> <p>But the foundation of all is <b>Economic</b> power. He who controls the kings gold, controls the king. Economic power exists in your estates, settlements under your command, and their population, production and facilities. Those 10 heavy knights need to have their plate armor and swords manufactured somewhere, and their war horses raised and trained. Those who control the means to <i>create</i> an army hold considerable power. But no city exists on its own. Trade is the weapon of economy, and to set up good trade, or bring in tribute, military and political power are always useful and sometimes necessary.</p> <p>To get started into the depths of Might & Fealty gameplay, you should strive to have at least one of your characters become a <i>lord or lady</i>, someone who holds his own estate. Will you take your first settlement by force, or have it granted to you in exchange for your loyalty?</p>))
# 4: ((missing translation - original: <p>Yesterday, I told you how the game is more like Game of Thrones than Total War, by showing you different paths to power. Today, some hints on estate management. If you do not yet have your own estate, keep them in mind for the future, because sooner or later, you will.</p> <p>The most important thing to keep in mind is to have a <i>purpose</i>. When it comes to trade, troops and construction, contrary to  many build-up games, you should not construct every building possible just because you can. Nor should you recruit the maximum possible amount of militia. Read on.</p> <p>For each of your estates, determine what it is for. Both for yourself and in the greater picture. Once you have determined that purpose, see which steps bring you closer, and which ones don't.</p> <p>For example, many villages primarily serve to provide food and other resources to a larger town or city. Building blacksmiths and training facilities in these villages is a waste, because these buildings will tie up workforce and thus reduce the production of resources - your primary purpose. However, some buildings such as a palisade help to ensure not every bandit walking by can take  control, and it also raises <a href="http://mightandfealty.com/manual/settlements">economic security</a>, which in turn improves resource production. For the same reason, you want to have a small militia stationed, even if the village is under no threat. And, of course, you want to construct buildings that provide useful resource production bonuses, such as the mill or the market.</p> <p>In larger settlements, focus is still useful. Do you really have to have production and training facilities for every imaginable type of soldiers and entourage, or do you want to focus? More focus means less wasted workforce and faster construction.</p> <p>In both cases, look through the <a href="http://mightandfealty.com/info/buildingtypes">building types</a> to see which buildings depend on what others and figure out in which order to build them. You can also check out the  <a href="http://mightandfealty.com/en/info/equipmenttypes">equipment types</a> to see which buildings you need to produce and train particular types of soldiers.</p> <p>One last thing to keep in mind is that <i>plans change</i>. When your major trading partner fails, or your realm changes shape, or just when you make other plans. Always be ready to change course and re-plan your estates and their purpose.</p>))
# 5: ((missing translation - original: <p>For your fifth day in the game, I will give you some hints on how the game differs from almost every other game out there. This matters a great deal because only by understanding these differences can you enjoy it to the max.</p> <p>The first thing is that Might & Fealty is a <b>sandbox game</b>. Fortunately, there are others out there that you can compare it to, like EVE Online or Dwarf Fortress or The Sims. By "sandbox" I mean that there are no quests or campaigns. You make your own goals and carve your own path, and so does every other player. On the one hand, everything is possible. On the other hand, you are responsible for making it happen. Like nature in the real world, the game world of Might & Fealty is cruel and doesn't care if your character lives or dies. The background world just happens, it doesn't wait for you nor does it have a specific path or storyline prepared. You can do whatever you want.</p> <p>Secondly, Might & Fealty is not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X">4X</a> game. "4X" stands for <i>"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate"</i> and sums up the gameplay of most strategy and wargames, where you begin small, build up your base/castle/empire/starship in order to expand and grow so you can defeat the enemy and win. While in Might & Fealty you will experience periods of growth and expansion, the game world itself is static and self-balancing - your growth only happens because you take land away from other players. This also means that at times, you will be the one who gets beaten up and loses lands, troops or even an entire realm. Unlike 4X games with their exponential growth towards domination, in Might & Fealty this is not the end of the game. Empires rise and fall throughout history, and while the empire might end, history does not.<br /> In consequence, don't expect the constant growth you know from other games. When you get your first estate, it is most likely already built-up to what it can sustain. It might be damaged from war, but it is unlikely that your village will grow into a large city. Remember yesterdays hints? Keep the <i>purpose</i> of each settlement in mind. If your estate is stable, you are doing nothing wrong, on the contrary, you are doing everything right.</p> <p>And finally, Might & Fealty is many games in one. If you don't like your current realm, or are losing a war, you can always start a new character and play somewhere else. No one can see which characters are yours if you don't link them up through family or other relationships, so there is nothing stopping you from switching sides and playing alongside of your former enemies. And since every character can die, your focus in the game should be your experience and fun, not the success or progress of individual characters. That is part of the fun, but the game itself is all about you, the player.</p> <hr /> <p>These hints should help you get into the game properly. Today was the last daily hint, we do not want to bother you with too many messages. You will receive a few more in longer intervals, to point out things you may have missed. And as always, feel free to explore the game in any way you wish.</p>))
# a: ((missing translation - original: <p>Here is another hint about smaller features that are less obvious but can deepen the gameplay of Might & Fealty considerably. If you want to get even more out of the game or are looking for something else to do while your political schemes unfold, here are some ideas:</p> <dl> <dt>Marriage</dt> <dd>Characters in the game can be engaged, marry, divorce, be unfaithful, take a lover and many more things. You can use these options for roleplaying, as political tools or just for fun.</dd> <dt>Historic Research</dt> <dd>For some historic events, only a limited amount of information is immediately available and scholars are needed to research more. Uncovering the long-lost history of a settlement and settling the question of its heritage can be both a challenge and an interesting side-quest.</dd> <dt>Dungeons</dt> <dd>And speaking of side-quests, you can also take your character into unexplored caves, ancient ruins and other places of danger and adventure, where you face progressively more dangerous enemies together. Finding a dungeon is a small quest all by itself and you may need the help of others who have heard of their location.</dd> </dl>))
# b: ((missing translation - original: <p>Here is one more - almost the last - gameplay hint that I want to share with you. It is about motivation.</p> <p>The summary is simple: <b>Never give up</b>. In Might & Fealty, you can never really lose. Sure, you might lose a battle, or control of a settlement. You can see your kingdom shattered and your family of characters hunted and hanged. But there is never a "game over" screen. You can always make a new character, retake your estates, found a new kingdom - revenge is always possible.</p> <p>Tides turn and fortunes change, but alliances also shift. Your enemy today may be your friend tomorrow - or vice versa. In addition to continuing your family or clan, you can also start a new character with no obvious relations to your family or kingdom. Might & Fealty never reveals which character is played by what player, so you always have to opportunity to simply start again with a blank slate.<br /> Since you can also rename characters, it is quite possible to roleplay infiltration this way, and then reveal your true colors once you have stuck your knife into the back of that hated enemy.</p> <p>As so often in this game, the possibilities are endless.</p>))
