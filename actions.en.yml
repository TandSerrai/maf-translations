    The ships can land you at most coastal locations, but you can only embark at a dock with the appropriate permissions or, of course,

 temple:
  name:         Visit Temple
  intro: >
    The local temple of %settlement% keeps a record of births and deaths, allowing you to trace back 
    the settlements development into time.<br />
    The priests have prepared a nice graph for you. As they explain, the height of the line shows the population, and the
    far right is yesterday, while the line further to the left goes into the past, with the number at the bottom showing how
    many days into the past.
  description:  Visit the local temple and its priests.

  description:  Declare your lordship over these people and make this settlement yours.
  unavailable:
   yours:       You already control this settlement.
   fortified:   You cannot take control of a fortified settlement from the outside.
  intro: >
    In order to command the resources and population of this %type%, you need to take control of it first.<br />
    This process simply takes time. In a small settlement, you simply convince the people directly, while in larger settlements you
    will take control of the local administration.<br />
    The amount of time required depends on the settlement size and on forces supporting and/or opposing you. This includes the local militia,
    which will automatically oppose you.<br />
    Taking control of this settlement will take an estimated %time%, if nobody else interferes.
  owned:        This settlement is currently controlled by %owner%.
  others: 
   title:       Other Control attempts
   intro: >
     The following nobles are also currently trying to take control of this settlement. Without diplomacy or battle, this will likely result in
     a mess of conflicting claims resolving over time. If you want to succeed, you will almost certainly have to make them all stop,
     either by convincing them or by attacking them.<br />
     Your other alternative is supporting someone else, which will speed up their process of taking the settlement.
  others2: 
   title:       Enemy Control attempts
   intro: >
     The following nobles are currently trying to take control of this settlement. You should almost certainly oppose each of them.
  defended: >
    Defending forces are making it more difficult to raise your banner. Attacking and culling them first might speed up your action.
  undefended: >
    There are no defending forces at this settlement, making it very easy and quick to take control.
  realm:        in the name of 
  submit:       take control
  success:      You are now in the process of taking control of this settlement. The process will take an estimated %time%, though this estimate will change with the support or opposition of other nobles.
  fail:
   defended:    This settlement is defended. Attack and defeat the defending forces first.

  name:         defend against taking
  description:  Your estate is currently being claimed by others, oppose them.
 changerealm:
  name:         Change realm allegiance.
  description:  Decide to which of your realms this settlement is aligned.
  notyours:     You do not control this settlement.
  norealms:     You do not belong to any realms.
  intro: >
    As the owner of %settlement%, you decide which realm it is considered to belong to. While this is a simple
    matter of declaration to change, the political consequences can be massive, so consider them well.<br />
    Also remember that your membership in realms depends on you holding estates within their hierarchy, so changing
    the allegiance of a settlement can result in you leaving a realm if it is your only estate within.
  current:      %settlement% is currently a part of %realm%.
  nocurrent:    %settlement% is not considered part of any realm at this time.
  realm:        change to realm
  submit:       change allegiance
  success:      You have successfully changed the allegiance of this settlement to %newrealm%.
  leftrealm:    Since you now hold no estates within %oldrealm% anymore, you are no longer a member of that realm.
  fail:
   same:        The settlement already belongs to this realm.
 grant:
  name:         grant control
  description:  Hand over control over these people to another noble.
  notyours:     You do not control this settlement.
  intro: >
    Settlements you control can be handed off to someone else.<br />
    Note that this does <em>not</em> make the recipient your vassal automatically. This action merely hands
    over control, questions of vassalage and legitimacy are for you to resolve.
  introwr: >
    You can grant a settlement "with its realm", meaning you make the new lord a member of the realm the settlement
    belongs to. Alternatively, you can grant without, which makes the settlement independent before granting it and
    is useful to giving settlements away to other realms.
  to:           grant control to
  withrealm:    with realm?
  submit:       grant
  success:      You have now given control over this settlement to %newowner%.
  queued:       You will soon be meeting with %newowner% and arrange the details of the transfer, as well as informing the settlement leaders.
 rename:
  name:         rename settlement
  description:  Change the name of this settlement.
  intro:        As the lord of this %type%, you can change its name to make it easier to distinguish, or to placate your ego.
  newname:      new name
  submit:       change name
  tooshort:     Settlement names should be at least 3 characters long.
  success: >
    You have now declared that this place shall be known as "%newname%".<br />
    Maps and signs will be updated at once.
  queued: >
    The settlement leaders have been instructed to change the name of this place to "%newname%".<br />
    Maps and signs will be updated over the next few hours. You will see the change completed soon.
 culture:
  name:         change culture
  description:  Change the culture of this settlement.
  intro: >
    As the lord of this <em>%current%</em> %type%, you can change its culture.<br />
    The culture of a settlement defines its flair, visuals and the names of the entourage and soldiers recruited here.<br />
    This should be used sparingly, as it would be unrealistic to change all the time. It also makes a lot more sense to
    communicate with your neighors and set up cultural areas.<br />
    <br />
    The central european is available to everyone. Additional cultures can be bought on your account page (Credits and Gifts). 
    If you conquer a settlement belonging to a culture you do not own, it will retain its culture, but you can only change 
    settlements to cultures you own.
  newculture:   new culture
  success: >
    You have now declared that this place follows the %culture% culture.
  queued: >
    The settlement leaders have been instructed to adapt to a %culture% culture.<br />
    You will see the change completed soon.

  description:  Set and change permissions for others
  intro: >
    As lord of %settlement%, you can determine how the settlement officials should treat others, if they should allow them
    into the settlement at all, if they can use the resources of the settlement to resupply or even pick up recruits.<br />
    To make everything more accessible, this system uses the <a href="%listsurl%">lists system</a> to define permission owners.
  submit:       set new permissions
  success:      Your new permissions have been saved.

  name:         Disengage
  description:  try to avoid the upcoming battle.
  longdesc:     attempt to disengage from the forces attacking you and avoid the battle that is currently being forced upon you.
  intro: >
    You are being attacked, and you may or may not be looking forward to this battle. As the enemy is still maneuvering to engage you,
    you can also still escape. With your current unit size, it will take %time% to pack up everything and leave, at which point you
    will find out if you succeed in making a run for it, or are already surrounded.
  battles:      choose the battle(s) you want to disengage from
  submit:       avoid battle
  success:      You have instructed your troops to pack up and avoid the upcoming battle. You might want to also travel away or you will probably be engaged again.
 evade:
  name:         Evade
  description:  evade enemy forces.
  longdesc:     Instruct your troops to automatically attempt to disengage from any battles you are forced into.
  intro: >
    You can instruct your troops to avoid any battles you are forced into. While this might sound like something you want to do all the time, also
    keep in mind that if you are travelling with a larger army of realm mates, it might mean some of you evade the battle and others don't, splitting
    forces up.<br />
    This action will remain in effect until you cancel it and apply to any and all battles that you do not voluntarily join.
  submit:       evade all battles
  success:      Your troops are now instructed to immediately disengage if a battle is forced upon you.
 settlement:
  all:          all military actions on settlements
  defend:
   name:        defend settlement
   description: set your troops up to defend this settlement, should it get attacked.

     They will set up defenses, making use of any fortifications available, and defend the settlement against
     anyone ordering an attack.

     Your soldiers are now preparing for an attack, and are ready to defend.

  attack:
   name:        attack settlement
   description: invade this settlement in order to kill or drive away its defenders.
   intro: >
     Order your soldiers to attack %settlement%.<br />
     There will be a battle between your forces as well as any other attackers, against the settlement militia
     and anyone choosing to defend. If you are victorious, you have forced your way into the settlement, and actions such as taking control of the
     settlement for yourself or attacking nobles inside will appear.<br />
     <i>Once initiated, battles cannot be cancelled. Once you are committed, you are committed. Decide wisely.</i>
   submit:      attack!  
   success:     Your soldiers are preparing for the attack and will commence battle shortly.
   reminder:    Remember that in order to not just attack, but also take control of the settlement, you need to issue a <a href="%url%">%take%</a> action as well.

   name:        initiate battle
   description: prepare for battle with other nobles.
   intro: >
     Face your enemies in battle by positioning your troops so they cannot easily retreat, forcing them into an encounter.<br />
     By declaring one or more primary targets, you decide who to engage. However, everyone within reach of the battle can join
     in on either your or their side, so you cannot be sure who you will face in the end.<br />
     Battle preparations take time depending on the size of the involved forces, so both you and your target(s) have a short time to call
     in allies for support.<br />
     If you are inside a settlement, you can only attack others who are also inside (but you can leave to attack those outside). If you are
     outside a settlement, you cannot attack nobles inside a settlement, you will have to attack the settlement to get inside.<br />
     <i>Once initiated, battles cannot be cancelled. Once you are committed, you are committed. Decide wisely.</i>
   success: >
     You are now engaging the enemy and battle prepartions are being made on both sides, estimated time until the battle will commence is %time%,

    Knights are lower nobles who fight in your name, using your soldiers. To attract new knights to your banner, you can set aside
    soldiers on your estate(s) that are available immediately to any knight on the condition of his loyalty.<br />
    Be aware of robber-knights, though. You should not make the majority of your troops available this way, or your new knights
    just might decide that looting or taking your estate is more rewarding.

    to be cowards or traitors.
