  intro: [[missing - original: This is an <b><i>experimental and possibly insecure</i></b> feature.<br /> Auto-Login will save a token in your browser, which enables it to complete the login procedure fully automated, giving you one-click logins (simply click on "login" and you are in).<br /><br /> <b>Security Advantage:</b> The token saved in your browser is not your password. In fact, when using auto-login, your password is not stored on your computer at all (unlike the password-manager functionality of most browsers) and is never transmitted across the Internet. If you lose or someone steals the token, simply click the enable button below again to generate a new token.<br /> <b>Security Danger:</b> If someone gets access to your computer or browser, he can log in to the game without knowing your password. Do not use this feature if you share your computer with other people. Do not <i>activate</i> it while you are on an insecure network, because if someone captures the token sent when you click the button, he can use it. <i>Additionally, this feature has not yet been peer-reviewed by other security experts and may contain additional weaknesses unknown at this time.</i><br /> <br /><br /> To activate or disable Auto-Login, click the buttons below:

So please, proper names only.<br /> Choosing a father and mother is optional, if you leave it empty then one or both of the parents will simply be people that don't exist as characters in the game.

description:
 scout: [[missing - original: Usually a fleet-footed peasant with good eyes, the scout will search the nearby area for anything unusual, notifying his noble of any finds.<br /> Scouts increase your spotting range. The more scouts you have, the farther away you notice details of the land and other characters.
]]
 prospector: [[missing - original: An expert in surveying and estimating, the prospector allows you to get data on the local economy and its capabilities. One prospector is enough, though you can choose to have more than one, just in case.
]]
 merchant: [[missing - original: Just like a sword is best met with a sword, and a thief with a thief, merchants are useful for setting up trade deals without being robbed blind by the middle men.<br /> One merchant is needed (and will stay behind) for each time you want to close a trade deal with more profitable transaction costs.
]]
 spy: [[missing - original: Spies are versatile experts in subterfuge and information gathering, allowing you to infiltrate an enemy (or friendly, if you are so inclined) settlement and gather details about its military or political status.
]]
 priest: [[missing - original: description TODO
]]
 herald: [[missing - original: Announcer and runner for a noble, who is not only practically a requirement if you want to be taken seriously as a major player in politics and diplomacy, he also allows you to send messages at spotting, rather than interaction distance.
]]
 translator: [[missing - original: A scribe trained in foreign languages, the translator allows you to send messages to nobles who do not speak or understand your language. One translator is enough, though you can choose to have more than one, just in case.
]]
 scholar: [[missing - original: Trained in the arts of reading and writing, documentation and a dozen other arts and techniques that a proper noble cares little about, the scholar can at times be useful to gather and sort information and old documents.<br /> His main use is to discover more about the history of people and places.
]]
 follower: [[missing - original: Camp followers are people following the soldiers in your army. They can be professionals, such as smiths, cooks or whores, or they can be relatives and family members of the soldiers. Camp followers allow your army to carry additional supplies and reserves, making resupply in the field possible.
]]
 axe: [[missing - original: An old and fairly primitive weapon, nevertheless both deadly and common on the battlefield.]]
 broadsword: [[missing - original: A heavy and sturdy sword designed more for massive impact force than speed.]]
 chainmail: [[missing - original: Interlocking metal rings providing impressive armor and yet fairly low weight.]]
 cloth armour: [[missing - original: Reinforced clothing, basically several layers of thick cloth. Does not really make much of a difference against real weapons, but can help against weak or glancing blows.]]
 crossbow: [[missing - original: Technically advanced ranged weapon that requires less training than a bow and provides more accurate power, but requires longer loading times.]]
 horse: [[missing - original: Riding horse trained to suffer through the heat of battle without too much complaining.]]
 improvised: [[missing - original: Farm tools, other tools, big sticks - anything that was lying around and just might hurt someone.]]
 javelin: [[missing - original: A short spear, balanced for throwing. One-use weapon that gives melee troops a small amount of ranged power.]]
 leather armour: [[missing - original: Hardened leather in multiple layers, slightly hindering movement but providing considerable protection.]]
 longbow: [[missing - original: The ultimate one-man ranged weapon, requiring long training and strong arms to use. Can pierce even solid metal armor at great distances.]]
 pike: [[missing - original: A long pole-arm weapon with a blade and point, easy to learn and often the first serious weapon for conscripts to pick up.]]
 plate armour: [[missing - original: The ultimate in armor protection, consisting of solid metal plates covering every part of the body, interlocked and reinforced.]]
 scale armour: [[missing - original: A mixture of metal and leather, the scale armor has a solid leather body with numerous metal plates overlayed, affording more freedom of movement than more solid metal armors.]]
 shield: [[missing - original: A primitive and yet highly efficient defensive choice, a shield protects against both melee and ranged attacks.]]
 shortbow: [[missing - original: A very common type of bow, used mainly for hunting but quite effective against lightly armored enemies, too.]]
 spear: [[missing - original: Another simple and common weapon, popular due to its considerable reach.]]
 sword: [[missing - original: Rare among the lower ranks, common amongst the nobility and those who can afford proper weaponsmiths.]]
 short sword: [[missing - original: A smaller sidearm to be used mostly as a fallback melee option for ranged troops, or as reserve weapon.]]
 war horse: [[missing - original: A large and heavy horse, specifically trained for battle and equipped with horse armor.]]

  title: Einleitung
  text: <p>Die folgenden Geschichte sind alle Teil der fiktiven Spielwelt, in Form von Legenden und Mythen, die dein Charakter zu hören bekommen könnte oder bereits kennt.</p> <p>Geschichten werden oft erzählt oder gesungen und weniger gelesen, da die meisten Bauern weder lesen noch schreiben können. In der Welt von Might & Fealty herrscht vor allem mündliche Überlieferung, obwohl viele der älteren oder bekannteren Legenden von Schriftgelerten niedergeschrieben wurden. Es gibt natürlich auch Autoren und Schreiben, auch wenn die meisten ihrer Werke eher aufgeführt als gelesen werden.</p>
