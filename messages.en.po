Do not use this feature if you share your computer with other people. Do not <i>activate</i> it while you are on an insecure network, because if someone captures the token sent when you click the button, he can use it. <i>Additionally, this feature has not yet been peer-reviewed by other security experts and may contain additional weaknesses unknown at this time.</i><br /> <br /><br /> To activate or disable Auto-Login, click the buttons below:
